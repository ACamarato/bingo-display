# Bingo Display

This is a Bingo game display board you can use if you don't have one of those heavy duty electronic bingo flashboards, but you do have a computer and a display or projector. 

Click on the number to light it up.  The most recent number is green, other called numbers are yellow.  Clear the screen with the clear button when the game is over.
